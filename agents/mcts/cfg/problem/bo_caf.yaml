description: Given a black-box maximization optimization problem with unknown heterogenous cost of evaluation, suppose I have trained the surrogate and cost model based on the evaluated samples, you need to create a totally new utility (different from the utilities in the literature) that quantifies the benefit of the given unobserved test input and budget information in each iteration.
